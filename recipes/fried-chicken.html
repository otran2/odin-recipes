  <!-- Ingredients and Measurements -->
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><p>1 (4 pound) Chicken, cut into pieces</p></li>
    <li><p>1 cup Buttermilk</p></li>
    <li><p>2 cups All-purpose Flour</p></li>
    <li><p>1 teaspoon Paprika</p></li>
    <li><p>Salt and Pepper to taste</p></li>
    <li><p>2 quarts Vegetable Oil</p></li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Recipe Steps -->
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.</p></li>
    <li><p>Place flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking 
      dictate the amount of flour you use). Season flour with paprika (which helps to 
      brown the chicken), salt and pepper.</p></li>
    <li><p>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, transfer them into the 
      bag with flour; seal the bag and shake to coat well.</p></li>
    <li><p>Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish 
      towel or waxed paper. LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. 
      THIS IS CRUCIAL!</p></li>
    <li><p>Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable 
      oil. Heat until VERY hot.</p></li>
    <li><p>Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in HOT 
      oil on both sides.</p></li>
    <li><p>When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the 
      chicken will be cooked through but not crispy). Remove cover, raise heat again, 
      and continue to fry until crispy.</p></li>
    <li><p>Drain fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, 
      you may have to fry in a few shifts. Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm 
      oven while preparing the rest.</p></li>
