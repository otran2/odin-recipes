# odin-recipes
The recipes assignment of The Odin Project

This project is essentially an compiilation of 3 recipes I have found from the website all recipes. I display the ingredients and steps for each recipe on a home page, with links to and from indivdual recipes.

The project aims to be a display of general and introductory html skills, including the use of a variety of tags and general basic formatting.
